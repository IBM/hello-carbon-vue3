## ðŸŽ¨ Calling All UX Designers!

Hey there, creative geniuses! Are you a UX designer who loves to experiment, ideate, and bring 
interfaces to life? Well, guess what? You're more than welcome to join the fun here!

This project is a showcase for Carbon components with Nuxt, so the only guideline is to highlight 
those amazing components in your designs. Whether you:

- Want to revamp the UI/UX for a smoother user experience,
- Have creative ideas for showcasing Carbon components in unique ways,
- Think the layout could use a bit more flair,
- Or simply want to experiment and have fun...

You're in the right place!

No suggestion is too wild, and no contribution is too small. Go open a pull request or just open an issue with a Figma
link, let your imagination run wild with the Carbon components. Weâ€™re here for brainstorming, prototyping, and
pixel-perfect designs (or not-so-perfect onesâ€”weâ€™re cool with that too).

## Prereqs
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating)
- Node v22 `nvm install 22`
- [Mockoon](https://mockoon.com/download/) - run mocks for comics endpoints
- Docker or [podman](https://podman.io/) or [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/)

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# npm
npm install
```

## Getting Started

A mock version of the comics endpoints is in [mock-api.json](./local-dev/mock/mock-api.json).
Load this in the Mockoon desktop app or start in the command line.
```shell
npm install -g @mockoon/cli
mockoon-cli start --data ./local-dev/mock/mock-api.json

```

## Set up the authentication (local mock)
```shell
cd local-dev
docker compose up
```
This will launch a local openid [keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/getting-started/getting-started-docker) server and allow you to log in with admin/potato-history

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
```shell
cp .env.example .env
```
Edit `.env` and change any values for your system

## Start the development server on

```bash
# npm
npm run dev
```
Server should be running at http://localhost:4507


Log in with admin/potato-history

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
# npm
npm run build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
# npm
npm run preview
```
